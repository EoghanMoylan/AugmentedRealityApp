When using your device, navigate to the folder where you stored the ".apk" file. If you do not have the option to navigate through your devices directory you may need to download an app such as [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.fm&hl=en). Tap on the ".apk" file and install the app.
